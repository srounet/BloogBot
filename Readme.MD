# BloogBot

This is an attempt at following the article series written by "Drew Kestell" on how to sneak into game process to change its behavior. Ultimately, his guide will guide you towards the writing of a Bot for popular mmorpg World Of Warcraft.
As a reminder and a disclaimer, I would like to express the fact that all that is written by Drew or exposed through this repository is for educational purpose only and the wish of learning new competencies and just having fun.

I strongly invite anyone who is reading this to start first at Drew's blog: https://drewkestell.us/Article/6/Chapter/1
